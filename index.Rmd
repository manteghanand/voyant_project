# Hypothesis:
There exists a class difference in science fiction books wherein there is a higher frequency of usage of words relating to the upper-class as compared to the lower-class.


# Introduction

The three of us are a combination of Computer Science and Economics majors. Naturally, we have no inclination towards English Literature. After discussing the novels we read we realized that, like the nerds we are, we only read science fiction and mystery novels. Therefore, it was quite easy for us to choose Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as our first author - we wanted to analyse the Sherlock Holmes series and compare it to other mystery/detective novels from the same time period and context. However, Gutenberg didn’t have a wide variety of books by other mystery/detective authors. 

Thus, we did what we were taught to do:

We chose to analyse Doyle’s sci-fi corpus with H. G. Wells’ corpus since they had the same genre, similar time, and of course, they were both British. We didn’t know where to go from there, so we did a little bit of research and looked at themes both authors covered in their books. An interesting one that we found was H. G. Well’s fascination with class. Our assumption was that since most of his books were based on a utopian society, we would mainly encounter the upper class - aristocratic, wealthy people living in mansions. So, we decided to compare the amount of times we came across upper class terms in both corpuses to check whether it was a recurring theme within science fiction novels. In order to further strengthen our analysis, we also decided to compare our results with Thomas Hardy’s and George Eliot’s corpuses (English authors from the same time period and non sci-fi writers) on Professor’s recommendation.

# Actual Stuff Begins Here:

To do so, we split our corpuses into 2 sections - one with science fiction authors and one with non science-fiction authors. It includes a combination of 33 books by H. G. Wells and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with a word count of 2,538,058, and a combination of 17 books by George Eliot and Thomas Hardy with a word count of 2,676,423. While we found a lot of similarities between the texts in terms of the most frequent words, they didn’t quite relate to our hypothesis. For example, we noticed that both corpuses had words such as “man”, “said”, “men”, and “little” as their most used words. But, what were we to do of this data? We also tried looking at the sentence length and vocabulary density in both corpuses. Instead of thinking about the author itself, we tried to think about class differences in the readers. A corpus with low vocabulary density and lesser average words per sentence would result in a book that is more accessible to the lower class (with the assumption that they are not very well-read). In the science-fiction corpus, we found that the highest vocabulary density was 0.160 and the lowest was 0.053. For the non science-fiction corpus, we found that the highest vocabulary density was 0.192 and the lowest was 0.049. This points towards a possibility that the non science fiction books were targeted towards a relatively more literate population as compared to the science fiction books. Although, it is important to note that the difference isn’t big enough to make a proper judgment on this subject.

# Frequency Distribution (Trends Tool)

The trends tool on Voyant is possibly one of the most useful tools on the site. By default it shows us the relative frequency of the occurrence of the most common words within the corpus. However, to contextualise our hypothesis, we decided to split our keywords into two categories; one with words relating to the upper-class and the other with words relating to the lower-class. We chose descriptive words for the upper-class such as king, bourgeoisie, wealthy, rich, noble, aristocratic, elite, well-off, blue-blood, imperial, posh, upmarket, exclusive, high society, privileged, gentry, mansion, etc. These included terms that describe the upper-class at face-value, and also include words that the lower-class would describe the upper-class as. Furthermore, we also added things that were exclusive to the upper-class such as the places they would live in. Similarly, we used terms such as village, poor, beggar, penniless, poverty, broke, destitute, bankrupt, empty-handed, needy and the n-word (Fun fact: Doyle was very racist in his books) to describe the lower-class.

After adding in terms relating to our study, we find the following graph for the science fiction corpus :

<iframe style='width: 1440px; height: 631px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=rich*%20%7C%20king*%20%7C%20queen*%20%7C%20lord*%20%7C%20lady*%20%7C%20prince*%20%7C%20royal*%20%7C%20wealth*%20%7C%20master*%20%7C%20&query=poor*%20%7C%20poverty*%20%7C%20filth*%20%7C%20servant*%20%7C%20maid*%20%7C%20beggar*%20%7C%20&corpus=3e25d54e66d7d4cbd0e7a03e77113534' data-external = '1'></iframe>

It is clear to see that the relative frequency of the usage of the terms relating to the upper-class far exceed the relative frequency of the terms relating to the lower-class. This means that throughout the corpus, there is more reference and involvement of the upper-class and relatively very little representation of the lower class.

We now move on to the non science fiction corpus and here is what we find from the graph:

<iframe style='width: 1440px; height: 632px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=poor*%20%7C%20poverty*%20%7C%20filth*%20%7C%20servant*%20%7C%20maid*%20%7C%20beggar*%20&query=rich*%20%7C%20king*%20%7C%20queen*%20%7C%20lord*%20%7C%20lady*%20%20%7C%20prince*%20%7C%20master*%20%7C%20royal*%20%7C%20wealth*%20%7C&view=corpuscollocates&corpus=3a13aa608e131ca1662452b61b6f2141' data-external = '1'></iframe>

Looking at the above grpah, it is clear to notice that apart from a couple of outliers, the vast majority of the corpus is more or less evenly representative of the lower-class as well as the upper-class.

When comparing the two grpahs we can see that there is a huge preference given to the upper-class in the case of the science fiction corpus but the same cannot be said about the non science fiction corpus

# Correlation and Colocates:

Correlation:

The correlation tool on Voyant can actually be quite handy when trying to understand the influence of the usage of certain terms upon the usage of some other terms. A higher correlation (with a decently high significance value) shows a strong correlation between the usage of the two terms. What this means is that the usage of a particular term actually points towards the usage of another term. A high positive correlation means that if the usage of term A is increased then the usage of term B will also increase. A low negative correlation means that if the usage of term A increases then the usage of term B would decrease. The significance value shown on voyant next to the correlation value represents how significant or valuable the correlation is to the entire document.

Upon inspection of the correlation data of our science fiction corpus, voyant points out that there simply aren’t any strong correlations within the corpus. Even though voyant shows some pretty strong significance for the relation between some terms, it still does not show any significant correlation. The highest correlation within the corpus values at around 0.248 is not strong enough to draw any inference. The lowest correlation within the corpus values at around -0.037 which yet again is not enough to draw any inference.

Collocates:

The collocates tool on Voyant is used to figure out the usage of certain terms along with some other terms. As in, which terms occur next to each other in the document. The count value represents the number of such occurrences within the corpus. A higher count of a certain term combination represents a recurring pattern within the corpus.


When first presented with the collocation data, voyant throws pairings with the most used word within the corpus, which in this case is “said” . Instead of completely ignoring that and searching for specific terms, we decided to use the huge amount of data available for “said” to our advantage. Here’s our thought process:

Since we are to find out the representation of different social classes within the corpus, we must look at the best way in which a character can be represented - through dialogue. The amount of times a character speaks within a text relates to the amount of influence they have within the text. So, if we just look at the the colocates of the word “said” with a set of different terms relating to different social classes, then we could get a rough idea of the representation of those classes within the text. Here is what we found:

<iframe style='width: 1440px; height: 631px;' src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTphFxM_3PLIe9E-yj6RHzRZHvrDZr7byjVBLYRJSNcMVUsWdZYTJjBXCe5PWwU9D4N7rp9M3T859Sk/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" data-external = '1'></iframe>

The science fiction category is heavily inclined towards the representation of the upper class, as is shown in the first table.
On the other hand, the non science fiction category has a fairly balanced representation of both the classes as in shown in the second table


# Bubble Lines (Third Tool)

After the never ending process of trying to understand what most tools on Voyant even do, we decided to take up bubble lines as our third tool. We wanted to pick a tool that could be a good representation of the class divide within our corpses or corpora ( credits @ Elijah for introducing this term )
Bubble line shows the frequency of certain terms within each document of the corpus. the size of the bubbles represents the magnitude of the usage of a particular term or set of terms. For example, a bigger bubble in the beginning of the document represents a higher frequency of the usage of certain terms in the beginning of the document. Similarly, a smaller bubble at the end of the document shows a relatively lower frequency of usage of a term or set of terms.

The above is an excerpt of the science fiction corpus ie. the corpus consisting of the works of Doyle and Wells. The size of the bubbles in the graph shows the frequency of the occurrence of particular terms and the positioning of the bubbles is in respect to the occurrence of terms within certain positions within the document. As it can be seen, the blue bubbles consisting of the terms associated with the upper class are spread fairly consistently throughout each document while also being bigger in size. This shows that these terms are a key component throughout the documents, which indicates that there is a heavy linkage of these terms with the plot of the texts.

The above image shows the data of the non science fiction texts ie. the texts of Thomas Hardy and George Eliot . Looking at the graph it is clear that except for some outliers (which specifically discussed themes of the royalty) the remaining documents in the corpus heavily rely on the consistent usage of the terms and themes surrounding the lower class as well as the upper class in a balanced manner.

# Reflection:

With full certainty, the three of us can say that Voyant was a really cool tool to work with, especially considering the fact that neither of us had any critical literary analysis skills. It provided us with a lot of details about our corpora and literature in general that we would have never received if we plainly read the books. On the other hand though, we do think that there are some bugs that require fixing and some tools that require more documentation. For example, we tried to use the StreamGraph tool. Even though it looked super interesting and we made a few basic inferences from it, we were not able to arrive at a plausible conclusion due to the lack of documentation on Voyant itself. 

In terms of our research itself: 
- Summary - We took vocabulary density and sentence length into account. Albeit sentence length is a good indicator of how accessible a corpus is to the general public, the vocabulary density highly depends upon the total number of words in the corpus - which makes it a lot less reliable than the other tools since there is a varying amount of text in each corpus. 
- Frequency Distribution - We considered a lot of terms that could gauge the distribution of upper-class and lower-class mentions and received data that supported our hypothesis. However, we did not consider context since we could not read the books ourselves. 
- Correlation and Colocates - Even though we did not receive any data from the correlation tool even though the significance of certain word correlations were high, this was quite a fascinating analytical tool to go through, as was the Colocation tool.
- Bubble Lines - This provided us with a lot of insight on the frequency of terms within the book that helped us support our hypothesis. 

# Conclusion

Okay so we did a whole bunch of stuff and now we’re at the end of the project. Here’s what we thought of it: 

- Trends - From the frequency distribution graph we were able to conclude that there is infact a huge difference in the way social classes are represented in science fiction and non science fiction books. This supports our hypothesis that there exists a class difference in science fiction books since the relative term frequency for tht upper-class far exceeds that of the lower-class.
- Correlation and Collocates - The correlation tool did not really provide us with much to work with, so we are just going to sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened. The collocates tool however gave us a lot to work with and after making a handy excel sheet to note down the total occurrences of the collocates, we yet again, were able to support our hypothesis since there exists a far greater representation in terms of speech (using the word “said”) for the upper-class as compared to the lower class in the science fiction corpus. The non science fiction corpus appears to be a far more equal space for both classes.
- Bubble lines - This tool proved to be another great way of visualizing the frequency of occurrence of certain terms within the documents within the corpus. Yet again we find a huge difference in the usage of the upper-class terms and the lower-class terms in the case of the science fiction corpus. The non science fiction corpus does not have that huge of a difference between the usage of terms pertaining to the classes (except for some clear outliers). With the third tool, we are once again able to support our hypothesis that science fiction has a great class divide.
